# panganan

## Project setup with CLI
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
vue ui
```
After running the "vue ui" command in the terminal or CLI, it will automatically switch to a browser displaying the page.

## setting and create project on Vue Manajer Project
Run/select "create" in the navbar and locate the project folder. Then, click "create a new project here."

The next step is to name the project folder and select a package manager. By default, the package manager doesn't select one of the available ones, so make sure you select the one you're using (npm, yarn, or pnpm). Then, click "next."

The final step in creating a project through the GUI is to select a preset. The "Panganan" project I developed uses the default preset. If you'd like to try other presets, feel free to do so. Don't forget to click "create project."
This page also provides plugins and dependencies that can be used to assist the project development process.

## Running the Project
After the plugins and dependencies are successfully installed, you can run the project via "Tasks" on the sidebar, then select "serve" and press the "Run task" button, then the project that has been created will automatically run.

The Build command is used to generate a production-ready version of the application.
When you run the build process:
- The source code will be optimized and bundled
- The output will be generated into a dist folder
- The result is ready to be deployed to a hosting/server environment

Use Build when the project is finished and ready for deployment, not during development.

## Project Structure & Source Code
To see the code or syntax, you can open the project folder that you placed when setting up and creating the project on the Vue Project Manager.
All application logic, components, views, and configurations are located inside this project directory and can be modified using any code editor such as Visual Studio Code.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
